Payload's powerful Versions functionality allows you to keep a running history of changes over time.

When enabled, Payload will automatically scaffold a new Collection in your database to store versions of your document(s) over time, and the Admin UI will be extended with additional views that allow you to browse document versions, view diffs in order to see exactly what has changed in your documents (and when), and restore documents back to prior versions easily.

**With Versions, you can:**

- Maintain a history of every change ever made to a document, including monitoring for what user made which change
- Restore documents and globals to prior states in case you need to roll back changes
- Build a true [/docs/versions/drafts](Draft Preview)) mode for your data
- Manage who can see Drafts, and who can only see Published documents via [Access Control](/docs/access-control/overview)
- Enable [Autosave](/docs/versions/autosave) on collections and globals to never lose your work again
- Build a powerful publishing schedule mechanism to create documents and have them become publicly readable automatically at a future date

	Versions are extremely performant and totally opt-in. They don't change the shape of your data at all. All versions are stored in a separate Collection and can be turned on and off easily at your discretion.

### Collections

Configuring Versions is done by adding the `versions` key to your Collection configs. Set it to `true` to enable default Versions settings, or customize versions options by setting the property equal to an object containing the following available options:

| Option                       | Description  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------|
| `maxPerDoc`                  | Use this setting to control how many versions to keep on a document by document basis. Must be an integer. |
| `retainDeleted`              | Boolean to determine if, when a document is deleted, you'd like to retain versions of that document, or go through and automatically delete all versions that are associated with the deleted document. |
| `drafts `                    | Enable [Drafts](/docs/versions/drafts) mode for this collection. |
